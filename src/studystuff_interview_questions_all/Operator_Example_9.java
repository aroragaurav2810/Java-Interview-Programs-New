/*Here we have found a new logic on string i.e What we have heared is that whenever 
there is a string, all process turns to concatenation but In print statement 3, you can see, 
first there is numeric operator then we have string, so in this concatenation won't work because,
string concept from left to right, so if in case numeric operators were after string then they get concatenate 
instead summing*/
