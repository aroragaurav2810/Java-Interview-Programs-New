	 MultiThreading:
	  A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. 
	  Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.

	Main Thread:
	When a Java program starts up, one thread begins running immediately. 
	This is usually called the main thread of our program, because it is the one that is executed when our program begins.
	
	Properties of Main Thread:
	It is the thread from which other “child” threads will be spawned.
	Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions
	
	
	Why MultiThreading in Java:
	Let's take an example of Stock trading application where user downloads the transaction report, 
	along with that monitors the stocks price and trade like buy or sell the stocks, 
	As the transaction report takes time to download, it does not halt users for buying or selling the stock 
	along with monitoring the prices of stock. This is all done by the use of multi threading in an application. 
	
	NOTE: In multi threading enviornment, a program has two or more parts that run concurrently, These parts are called thread 
	and you may be wondering how these parts/threads of a program executes/runs concurrently because of their separate execution path
